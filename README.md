Hi! I'm Katelyn
I'm currently a high school student in New York City and I'm interestd in software engineering, music, art, and fashion. Being in New York is really fast pace so I usually pick up a lot of new interest and hobbies,
which is how I got into coding!. I'm hoping to improve my coding and problem solving skills as I continue to code as time goes by. Other then coding I love art and fashion related things, I love wearing new things and experimenting
with what I wear!. I also love learning new things and challenge myself to do so, which is why im interested in coding!
